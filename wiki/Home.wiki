= Introduction =

*Glade* is a simple, easy-to-use, 8-bit audio library for the [http://www.arduino.cc/ Arduino]. It allows you to play sound on the pin 11 of the Arduino board using PWM. The library is separated in two:
 # the *Audio* library provides a simple interface for 8-bit audio playback, inspired from [http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/PCMAudio this code]
 # the *Glade* library provides a framework for audio plugins that can be linked to one another in a dataflow-like way, inspired from [http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/ ChucK] and [http://puredata.info/ PureData]

= Features =

== Supported ==
 * mono and stereo audio playback
 * dataflow connections
 * feedback
 * generators: square wave, audio clip
 * transformers/filters: blend, delay
 * sinks: output (dac)

== Targeted ==
 * generators: triangle/razor wave, sine wave (osc)
 * basic operators: + - * /
 * source: analog-digital-converter (adc)
 * [http://chuck.cs.princeton.edu/doc/program/ugen.html others...]

= Example =
{{{
#include <Audio.h>
#include <Glade.h>

// build a 440Hz frequency square wave generator with amplitude 100 (on a max of 127)
GladeSquare source(440, 100);

void setup() {
  dac.connect(0, &source); // connect the source to the dac (output)
  Glade.build(); // build the play line (needs to be called whenever connections are changed)
  Audio.start(STEREO, 8000); // start audio playback in stereo mode at 8000 Hz
}

void loop()
{
  source.frequency += 0.001; // will slowly increase frequency
  Glade.run(); // run audio
}
